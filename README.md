# sid2sng

Converts sid files back to GoatTracker2 sng files.

Note: sid files need to have been generated via GoatTracker2.

It doesn't work for all sid files, especially those that have certain features disables, sorry.
For example, it's assumed that all four different tables have been.
Despite these limitations, this tool might be quite useful for some.


## TODO

+ auto-detect detect missing tables
+ fix bugs
